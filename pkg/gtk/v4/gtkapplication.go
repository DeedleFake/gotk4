// Application is a class that handles many important aspects of a GTK+
// application in a convenient fashion, without enforcing a one-size-fits-all
// application model.
//
// Currently, GtkApplication handles GTK initialization, application uniqueness,
// session management, provides some basic scriptability and desktop shell
// integration by exporting actions and menus and manages a list of toplevel
// windows whose life-cycle is automatically tied to the life-cycle of your
// application.
//
// While GtkApplication works fine with plain Windows, it is recommended to use
// it together with ApplicationWindow.
//
// When GDK threads are enabled, GtkApplication will acquire the GDK lock when
// invoking actions that arrive from other processes. The GDK lock is not
// touched for local action invocations. In order to have actions invoked in a
// predictable context it is therefore recommended that the GDK lock be held
// while invoking actions locally with g_action_group_activate_action(). The
// same applies to actions associated with ApplicationWindow and to the
// “activate” and “open” #GApplication methods.
//
//
// Automatic resources
//
// Application will automatically load menus from the Builder resource located
// at "gtk/menus.ui", relative to the application's resource base path (see
// g_application_set_resource_base_path()). The menu with the ID "menubar" is
// taken as the application's menubar. Additional menus (most interesting
// submenus) can be named and accessed via gtk_application_get_menu_by_id()
// which allows for dynamic population of a part of the menu structure.
//
// It is also possible to provide the menubar manually using
// gtk_application_set_menubar().
//
// Application will also automatically setup an icon search path for the default
// icon theme by appending "icons" to the resource base path. This allows your
// application to easily store its icons as resources. See
// gtk_icon_theme_add_resource_path() for more information.
//
// If there is a resource located at "gtk/help-overlay.ui" which defines a
// ShortcutsWindow with ID "help_overlay" then GtkApplication associates an
// instance of this shortcuts window with each ApplicationWindow and sets up the
// keyboard accelerator Control-? to open it. To create a menu item that
// displays the shortcuts window, associate the item with the action
// win.show-help-overlay.
//
//
// A simple application
//
// A simple example
// (https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/tree/master/examples/bp/bloatpad.c)
//
// GtkApplication optionally registers with a session manager of the users
// session (if you set the Application:register-session property) and offers
// various functionality related to the session life-cycle.
//
// An application can block various ways to end the session with the
// gtk_application_inhibit() function. Typical use cases for this kind of
// inhibiting are long-running, uninterruptible operations, such as burning a CD
// or performing a disk backup. The session manager may not honor the inhibitor,
// but it can be expected to inform the user about the negative consequences of
// ending the session while inhibitors are present.
