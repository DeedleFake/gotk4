// TreeModelFilter: a TreeModelFilter is a tree model which wraps another tree
// model, and can do the following things:
//
// - Filter specific rows, based on data from a “visible column”, a column
// storing booleans indicating whether the row should be filtered or not, or
// based on the return value of a “visible function”, which gets a model, iter
// and user_data and returns a boolean indicating whether the row should be
// filtered or not.
//
// - Modify the “appearance” of the model, using a modify function. This is
// extremely powerful and allows for just changing some values and also for
// creating a completely different model based on the given child model.
//
// - Set a different root node, also known as a “virtual root”. You can pass in
// a TreePath indicating the root node for the filter at construction time.
//
// The basic API is similar to TreeModelSort. For an example on its usage, see
// the section on TreeModelSort.
//
// When using TreeModelFilter, it is important to realize that TreeModelFilter
// maintains an internal cache of all nodes which are visible in its clients.
// The cache is likely to be a subtree of the tree exposed by the child model.
// TreeModelFilter will not cache the entire child model when unnecessary to not
// compromise the caching mechanism that is exposed by the reference counting
// scheme. If the child model implements reference counting, unnecessary signals
// may not be emitted because of reference counting rule 3, see the TreeModel
// documentation. (Note that e.g. TreeStore does not implement reference
// counting and will always emit all signals, even when the receiving node is
// not visible).
//
// Because of this, limitations for possible visible functions do apply. In
// general, visible functions should only use data or properties from the node
// for which the visibility state must be determined, its siblings or its
// parents. Usually, having a dependency on the state of any child node is not
// possible, unless references are taken on these explicitly. When no such
// reference exists, no signals may be received for these child nodes (see
// reference couting rule number 3 in the TreeModel section).
//
// Determining the visibility state of a given node based on the state of its
// child nodes is a frequently occurring use case. Therefore, TreeModelFilter
// explicitly supports this. For example, when a node does not have any
// children, you might not want the node to be visible. As soon as the first row
// is added to the node’s child level (or the last row removed), the node’s
// visibility should be updated.
//
// This introduces a dependency from the node on its child nodes. In order to
// accommodate this, TreeModelFilter must make sure the necessary signals are
// received from the child model. This is achieved by building, for all nodes
// which are exposed as visible nodes to TreeModelFilter's clients, the child
// level (if any) and take a reference on the first node in this level.
// Furthermore, for every row-inserted, row-changed or row-deleted signal (also
// these which were not handled because the node was not cached),
// TreeModelFilter will check if the visibility state of any parent node has
// changed.
//
// Beware, however, that this explicit support is limited to these two cases.
// For example, if you want a node to be visible only if two nodes in a child’s
// child level (2 levels deeper) are visible, you are on your own. In this case,
// either rely on TreeStore to emit all signals because it does not implement
// reference counting, or for models that do implement reference counting,
// obtain references on these child levels yourself.
