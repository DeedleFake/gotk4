// Application: a #GApplication is the foundation of an application. It wraps
// some low-level platform-specific services and is intended to act as the
// foundation for higher-level application classes such as Application or
// Application. In general, you should not use this class outside of a higher
// level framework.
//
// GApplication provides convenient life cycle management by maintaining a "use
// count" for the primary application instance. The use count can be changed
// using g_application_hold() and g_application_release(). If it drops to zero,
// the application exits. Higher-level classes such as Application employ the
// use count to ensure that the application stays alive as long as it has any
// opened windows.
//
// Another feature that GApplication (optionally) provides is process
// uniqueness. Applications can make use of this functionality by providing a
// unique application ID. If given, only one application with this ID can be
// running at a time per session. The session concept is platform-dependent, but
// corresponds roughly to a graphical desktop login. When your application is
// launched again, its arguments are passed through platform communication to
// the already running program. The already running instance of the program is
// called the "primary instance"; for non-unique applications this is always the
// current instance. On Linux, the D-Bus session bus is used for communication.
//
// The use of #GApplication differs from some other commonly-used uniqueness
// libraries (such as libunique) in important ways. The application is not
// expected to manually register itself and check if it is the primary instance.
// Instead, the main() function of a #GApplication should do very little more
// than instantiating the application instance, possibly connecting signal
// handlers, then calling g_application_run(). All checks for uniqueness are
// done internally. If the application is the primary instance then the startup
// signal is emitted and the mainloop runs. If the application is not the
// primary instance then a signal is sent to the primary instance and
// g_application_run() promptly returns. See the code examples below.
//
// If used, the expected form of an application identifier is the same as that
// of of a D-Bus well-known bus name
// (https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-protocol-names-bus).
// Examples include: `com.example.MyApp`,
// `org.example.internal_apps.Calculator`, `org._7_zip.Archiver`. For details on
// valid application identifiers, see g_application_id_is_valid().
//
// On Linux, the application identifier is claimed as a well-known bus name on
// the user's session bus. This means that the uniqueness of your application is
// scoped to the current session. It also means that your application may
// provide additional services (through registration of other object paths) at
// that bus name. The registration of these object paths should be done with the
// shared GDBus session bus. Note that due to the internal architecture of
// GDBus, method calls can be dispatched at any time (even if a main loop is not
// running). For this reason, you must ensure that any object paths that you
// wish to register are registered before #GApplication attempts to acquire the
// bus name of your application (which happens in g_application_register()).
// Unfortunately, this means that you cannot use g_application_get_is_remote()
// to decide if you want to register object paths.
//
// GApplication also implements the Group and Map interfaces and lets you easily
// export actions by adding them with g_action_map_add_action(). When invoking
// an action by calling g_action_group_activate_action() on the application, it
// is always invoked in the primary instance. The actions are also exported on
// the session bus, and GIO provides the BusActionGroup wrapper to conveniently
// access them remotely. GIO provides a BusMenuModel wrapper for remote access
// to exported Models.
//
// There is a number of different entry points into a GApplication:
//
// - via 'Activate' (i.e. just starting the application)
//
// - via 'Open' (i.e. opening some files)
//
// - by handling a command-line
//
// - via activating an action
//
// The #GApplication::startup signal lets you handle the application
// initialization for all of these in a single place.
//
// Regardless of which of these entry points is used to start the application,
// GApplication passes some ‘platform data’ from the launching instance to the
// primary instance, in the form of a #GVariant dictionary mapping strings to
// variants. To use platform data, override the @before_emit or @after_emit
// virtual functions in your #GApplication subclass. When dealing with
// CommandLine objects, the platform data is directly available via
// g_application_command_line_get_cwd(),
// g_application_command_line_get_environ() and
// g_application_command_line_get_platform_data().
//
// As the name indicates, the platform data may vary depending on the operating
// system, but it always includes the current directory (key "cwd"), and
// optionally the environment (ie the set of environment variables and their
// values) of the calling process (key "environ"). The environment is only added
// to the platform data if the G_APPLICATION_SEND_ENVIRONMENT flag is set.
// #GApplication subclasses can add their own platform data by overriding the
// @add_platform_data virtual function. For instance, Application adds startup
// notification data in this way.
//
// To parse commandline arguments you may handle the #GApplication::command-line
// signal or override the local_command_line() vfunc, to parse them in either
// the primary instance or the local instance, respectively.
//
// For an example of opening files with a GApplication, see
// gapplication-example-open.c
// (https://git.gnome.org/browse/glib/tree/gio/tests/gapplication-example-open.c).
//
// For an example of using actions with GApplication, see
// gapplication-example-actions.c
// (https://git.gnome.org/browse/glib/tree/gio/tests/gapplication-example-actions.c).
//
// For an example of using extra D-Bus hooks with GApplication, see
// gapplication-example-dbushooks.c

	// AddMainOptionEntries adds main option entries to be handled by
	// @application.
	//
	// This function is comparable to g_option_context_add_main_entries().
	//
	// After the commandline arguments are parsed, the
	// #GApplication::handle-local-options signal will be emitted. At this
	// point, the application can inspect the values pointed to by @arg_data in
	// the given Entrys.
	//
	// Unlike Context, #GApplication supports giving a nil @arg_data for a
	// non-callback Entry. This results in the argument in question being packed
	// into a Dict which is also passed to #GApplication::handle-local-options,
	// where it can be inspected and modified. If
	// G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE is set, then the resulting dictionary
	// is sent to the primary instance, where
	// g_application_command_line_get_options_dict() will return it. This
	// "packing" is done according to the type of the argument -- booleans for
	// normal flags, strings for strings, bytestrings for filenames, etc. The
	// packing only occurs if the flag is given (ie: we do not pack a "false"
	// #GVariant in the case that a flag is missing).
	//
	// In general, it is recommended that all commandline arguments are parsed
	// locally. The options dictionary should then be used to transmit the
	// result of the parsing to the primary instance, where
	// g_variant_dict_lookup() can be used. For local options, it is possible to
	// either use @arg_data in the usual way, or to consult (and potentially
	// remove) the option from the options dictionary.
	//
	// This function is new in GLib 2.40. Before then, the only real choice was
	// to send all of the commandline arguments (options and all) to the primary
	// instance for handling. #GApplication ignored them completely on the local
	// side. Calling this function "opts in" to the new behaviour, and in
	// particular, means that unrecognised options will be treated as errors.
	// Unrecognised options have never been ignored when
	// G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE is unset.
	//
	// If #GApplication::handle-local-options needs to see the list of
	// filenames, then the use of G_OPTION_REMAINING is recommended. If
	// @arg_data is nil then G_OPTION_REMAINING can be used as a key into the
	// options dictionary. If you do use G_OPTION_REMAINING then you need to
	// handle these arguments for yourself because once they are consumed, they
	// will no longer be visible to the default handling (which treats them as
	// filenames to be opened).
	//
	// It is important to use the proper GVariant format when retrieving the
	// options with g_variant_dict_lookup(): - for G_OPTION_ARG_NONE, use `b` -
	// for G_OPTION_ARG_STRING, use `&s` - for G_OPTION_ARG_INT, use `i` - for
	// G_OPTION_ARG_INT64, use `x` - for G_OPTION_ARG_DOUBLE, use `d` - for
	// G_OPTION_ARG_FILENAME, use `^&ay` - for G_OPTION_ARG_STRING_ARRAY, use

	AddMainOptionEntries(entries []glib.OptionEntry)
	// AddOptionGroup adds a Group to the commandline handling of @application.
	//
	// This function is comparable to g_option_context_add_group().
	//
	// Unlike g_application_add_main_option_entries(), this function does not
	// deal with nil @arg_data and never transmits options to the primary
	// instance.
	//
	// The reason for that is because, by the time the options arrive at the
	// primary instance, it is typically too late to do anything with them.
	// Taking the GTK option group as an example: GTK will already have been
	// initialised by the time the #GApplication::command-line handler runs. In
	// the case that this is not the first-running instance of the application,
	// the existing instance may already have been running for a very long time.
	//
	// This means that the options from Group are only really usable in the case
	// that the instance of the application being run is the first instance.
	// Passing options like `--display=` or `--gdk-debug=` on future runs will
	// have no effect on the existing primary instance.
	//
	// Calling this function will cause the options in the supplied option group
	// to be parsed, but it does not cause you to be "opted in" to the new
	// functionality whereby unrecognised options are rejected even if
	// G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE was given.

// AddMainOptionEntries adds main option entries to be handled by

//
// This function is comparable to g_option_context_add_main_entries().
//
// After the commandline arguments are parsed, the
// #GApplication::handle-local-options signal will be emitted. At this
// point, the application can inspect the values pointed to by @arg_data in
// the given Entrys.
//
// Unlike Context, #GApplication supports giving a nil @arg_data for a
// non-callback Entry. This results in the argument in question being packed
// into a Dict which is also passed to #GApplication::handle-local-options,
// where it can be inspected and modified. If
// G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE is set, then the resulting dictionary
// is sent to the primary instance, where
// g_application_command_line_get_options_dict() will return it. This
// "packing" is done according to the type of the argument -- booleans for
// normal flags, strings for strings, bytestrings for filenames, etc. The
// packing only occurs if the flag is given (ie: we do not pack a "false"
// #GVariant in the case that a flag is missing).
//
// In general, it is recommended that all commandline arguments are parsed
// locally. The options dictionary should then be used to transmit the
// result of the parsing to the primary instance, where
// g_variant_dict_lookup() can be used. For local options, it is possible to
// either use @arg_data in the usual way, or to consult (and potentially
// remove) the option from the options dictionary.
//
// This function is new in GLib 2.40. Before then, the only real choice was
// to send all of the commandline arguments (options and all) to the primary
// instance for handling. #GApplication ignored them completely on the local
// side. Calling this function "opts in" to the new behaviour, and in
// particular, means that unrecognised options will be treated as errors.
// Unrecognised options have never been ignored when
// G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE is unset.
//
// If #GApplication::handle-local-options needs to see the list of
// filenames, then the use of G_OPTION_REMAINING is recommended. If
// @arg_data is nil then G_OPTION_REMAINING can be used as a key into the
// options dictionary. If you do use G_OPTION_REMAINING then you need to
// handle these arguments for yourself because once they are consumed, they
// will no longer be visible to the default handling (which treats them as
// filenames to be opened).
//
// It is important to use the proper GVariant format when retrieving the
// options with g_variant_dict_lookup(): - for G_OPTION_ARG_NONE, use `b` -
// for G_OPTION_ARG_STRING, use `&s` - for G_OPTION_ARG_INT, use `i` - for
// G_OPTION_ARG_INT64, use `x` - for G_OPTION_ARG_DOUBLE, use `d` - for

//
// The reason for that is because, by the time the options arrive at the

// that the instance of the application being run is the first instance.
