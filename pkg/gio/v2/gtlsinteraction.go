// TLSInteraction provides a mechanism for the TLS connection and database code
// to interact with the user. It can be used to ask the user for passwords.
//
// To use a Interaction with a TLS connection use
// g_tls_connection_set_interaction().
//
// Callers should instantiate a derived class that implements the various
// interaction methods to show the required dialogs.
//
// Callers should use the 'invoke' functions like
// g_tls_interaction_invoke_ask_password() to run interaction methods. These
// functions make sure that the interaction is invoked in the main loop and not
// in the current thread, if the current thread is not running the main loop.
//
// Derived classes can choose to implement whichever interactions methods they'd
// like to support by overriding those virtual methods in their class
// initialization function. Any interactions not implemented will return
// G_TLS_INTERACTION_UNHANDLED. If a derived class implements an async method,
// it must also implement the corresponding finish method.
