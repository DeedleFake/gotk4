// NewKeyfileSettingsBackend creates a keyfile-backed Backend.
//
// The filename of the keyfile to use is given by @filename.
//
// All settings read to or written from the backend must fall under the path
// given in @root_path (which must start and end with a slash and not contain
// two consecutive slashes). @root_path may be "/".
//
// If @root_group is non-nil then it specifies the name of the keyfile group
// used for keys that are written directly below @root_path. For example, if
// @root_path is "/apps/example/" and @root_group is "toplevel", then settings
// the key "/apps/example/enabled" to a value of true will cause the following
// to appear in the keyfile:
//
//    [toplevel]
//    enabled=true
//
// If @root_group is nil then it is not permitted to store keys directly below
// the @root_path.
//
// For keys not stored directly below @root_path (ie: in a sub-path), the name
// of the subpath (with the final slash stripped) is used as the name of the
// keyfile group. To continue the example, if
// "/apps/example/profiles/default/font-size" were set to 12 then the following
// would appear in the keyfile:
//
//    [profiles/default]
//    font-size=12
//
// The backend will refuse writes (and return writability as being false) for
// keys outside of @root_path and, in the event that @root_group is nil, also
// for keys directly under @root_path. Writes will also be refused if the
// backend detects that it has the inability to rewrite the keyfile (ie: the
// containing directory is not writable).
//
// There is no checking done for your key namespace clashing with the syntax of
// the key file format. For example, if you have '[' or ']' characters in your
// path names or '=' in your key names you may be in trouble.
//
// The backend reads default values from a keyfile called `defaults` in the
// directory specified by the SettingsBackend:defaults-dir property, and a list
// of locked keys from a text file with the name `locks` in the same location.

// SettingsBackend: the Backend interface defines a generic interface for
// non-strictly-typed data that is stored in a hierarchy. To implement an
// alternative storage backend for #GSettings, you need to implement the Backend
// interface and then make it implement the extension point
// SETTINGS_BACKEND_EXTENSION_POINT_NAME.
//
// The interface defines methods for reading and writing values, a method for
// determining if writing of certain values will fail (lockdown) and a change
// notification mechanism.
//
// The semantics of the interface are very precisely defined and implementations
// must carefully adhere to the expectations of callers that are documented on
// each of the interface methods.
//
// Some of the Backend functions accept or return a #GTree. These trees always
// have strings as keys and #GVariant as values.
// g_settings_backend_create_tree() is a convenience function to create suitable
// trees.
//
// The Backend API is exported to allow third-party implementations, but does
// not carry the same stability guarantees as the public GIO API. For this
// reason, you have to define the C preprocessor symbol
// G_SETTINGS_ENABLE_BACKEND before including `gio/gsettingsbackend.h`.
