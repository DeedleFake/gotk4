// SocketClient is a lightweight high-level utility class for connecting to a
// network host using a connection oriented socket type.
//
// You create a Client object, set any options you want, and then call a sync or
// async connect operation, which returns a Connection subclass on success.
//
// The type of the Connection object returned depends on the type of the
// underlying socket that is in use. For instance, for a TCP/IP connection it
// will be a Connection.
//
// As Client is a lightweight object, you don't need to cache it. You can just
