// To create a buffered input stream, use g_buffered_input_stream_new(), or
// g_buffered_input_stream_new_sized() to specify the buffer's size at
// construction.
//
// To get the size of a buffer within a buffered input stream, use
// g_buffered_input_stream_get_buffer_size(). To change the size of a buffered
// input stream's buffer, use g_buffered_input_stream_set_buffer_size(). Note
// that the buffer's size cannot be reduced below the size of the data within
// the buffer.
