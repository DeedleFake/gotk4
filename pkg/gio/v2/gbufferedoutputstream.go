// BufferedOutputStream: buffered output stream implements OutputStream and

//
// To create a buffered output stream, use g_buffered_output_stream_new(), or
// g_buffered_output_stream_new_sized() to specify the buffer's size at
// construction.
//
// To get the size of a buffer within a buffered input stream, use
// g_buffered_output_stream_get_buffer_size(). To change the size of a buffered
// output stream's buffer, use g_buffered_output_stream_set_buffer_size(). Note
