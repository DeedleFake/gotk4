// Geometry: the Geometry struct gives the window manager information about a

//
// gdk_window_set_geometry_hints() expects the hints to be fully valid already
// and simply passes them to the window manager; in contrast,
// gtk_window_set_geometry_hints() performs some interpretation. For example,
// Window will apply the hints to the geometry widget instead of the toplevel
// window, if you set a geometry widget. Also, the
// @min_width/@min_height/@max_width/@max_height fields may be set to -1, and
// Window will substitute the size request of the window or geometry widget. If
// the minimum size hint is not provided, Window will use its requisition as the
// minimum size. If the minimum size is provided and a geometry widget is set,
// Window will take the minimum size as the minimum size of the geometry widget
// rather than the entire window. The base size is treated similarly.
//
// The canonical use-case for gtk_window_set_geometry_hints() is to get a
// terminal widget to resize properly. Here, the terminal text area should be
// the geometry widget; Window will then automatically set the base size to the
// size of other widgets in the terminal window, such as the menubar and
// scrollbar. Then, the @width_inc and @height_inc fields should be set to the
// size of one character in the terminal. Finally, the base size should be set
// to the size of one character. The net effect is that the minimum size of the
// terminal will have a 1x1 character terminal area, and only terminal sizes on
// the “character grid” will be allowed.
//
// Here’s an example of how the terminal example would be implemented, assuming
// a terminal area widget called “terminal” and a toplevel window “toplevel”:
//
//    	GdkGeometry hints;
//
//    	hints.base_width = terminal->char_width;
