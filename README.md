[![built with nix](https://builtwithnix.org/badge.svg)](https://builtwithnix.org)

A GTK4 bindings generator for Go.

[Package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/diamondburned/gotk4/pkg) |
[Package examples](https://github.com/diamondburned/gotk4-examples) |
[GIR documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/diamondburned/gotk4/gir) |
[Progress tracker](https://github.com/diamondburned/gotk4/issues/2)

All generated packages are in `pkg/`. The generation code is in `gir/girgen/`.
At the moment, the repository depends on gotk3's GLib. This may change in the
future.

As of the time this README was written, most of `pkg/gtk4` and `pkg/gtk3` are
ready to be used for most purposes. However, memory leaks and sometimes crashes
may occur in certain parts of the API, while other parts might be completely
missing. In that case, an issue should be opened.
